1. Next-Word Predictor using LSTM (Beginner Project)

This beginner-level project uses an LSTM-based Sequential model to predict the next word in a sentence, offering a hands-on introduction to NLP with deep learning. 
It tokenizes text input, builds word sequences, applies one-hot encoding, and trains a simple LSTM network using Keras to generate predictions. 
Ideal for those exploring how machines understand language, the project includes training visualizations, evaluation metrics, and sample predictions to showcase performance and potential improvements.
